## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this Accordion FAQ challenge, I learned how to make an accordion component using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and a little JavaScript for the interactive accordion and a slide down animation.

### Continued development

For the future project, i would like to learn more about Tailwind CSS, probably i am going to use React + Tailwind.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me for the Tailwind utility classes.
- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) - This site helped me for the accordion animation.
